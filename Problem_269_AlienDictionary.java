// TOPOLOGICAL SORT -- involves a directed acyclical graph DAG --> has directed edges and no cycles
   // A topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). 
   // Given a DAG G = (V, E), a topological sort algorithm returns a sequence of vertices in which the vertices never come before their predecessors on any paths. 
   // In other words, if (u, v) âˆˆ E, v never appears before u in the sequence.

   // Notes:
   // Edge case: ape, apes --> ape will always be first
   // in the input, if we're given a list such that apes come BEFORE ape (eg [apes, ape]), then this is INVALID so we return an empty string

   // input array of strings is sorted lexicographically, so we use it to our advantage
   // BEFORE CODING: go through the input words and analyze the words pair by pair to see what kind of conclusions we could come up with
   // keep track of what goes before what
      // suppose the example ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
      // looking at the first 2 pairs, t comes BEFORE f, so t->f, so we're constructing a graph; next would be w->e
   // using these relations, we can build a graph --> then traverse the graph
      // w -> e -> r -> t -> f 
      // OUTPUT = "wertf" 
   // (1) now suppose that after processing the input, we have w -> e -> r -> t -> f -> w 
      // CYCLIC graph, ambiguous order, INVALID solution so return empty string
   // (2) now suppose that "rftt" did NOT exist in our input, we would then have 2 separate graphs: r -> t -> f AND w -> e 
      // this is still valid since there's not contradiction, the ordering still makes sense --> multiple possibilities of ordering:
         // "wertf" OR "rtfwe" OR bfs in which we would have "wretf"
            // note: all valid solutions above because what matters here is that we follow the graph's rules:
            // which is, w MUST come before e, r MUST come before t, t MUST come before f

      // POST ORDER DFS
      // Suppose words = ["A","BA","BC","C"] --> graph: A -> B -> C && A->C
         // if we construct the output just by pure DFS, we could possibly get "ACB" which would be wrong
      // hence post order DFS: adding nodes that are at the end first
         // we start traversing: we start at A, and then go to C; we see that C doesn't have any children so we add that to our output first
            // hence "C", then we pop back to A, and continue the DFS and we get to B, then we continue and get to C but C has been processed
            // hence "CB", then we process A so we get "CBA"
         // in short, we did leaf nodes first, then middle nodes, then beginning node
      // keep track of 2 things:
         // if a node has been visited/processed
         // if a node is in our current path (dictionary); every time we visit a node, we give it a value of false when added to path dictionary
            // then, once it's in our current path we're traversing, then we give it a value of true in the dictionary

   // TC: O(n), n as number of characters in the input, since we're traversing the graph we built
